To all the hiring managers named Greg... I am sorry. But you know what you did. Be honest.

WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?
 - A solution for the disconnect between the developer and management. When asked to estimate the completion date of a project, the manager wants a commitment, but the developer tends to give a ballpark figure. (Usually overly hopeful.) What do we do?
 - Robert C. Martin recommends we developers brush up on the power of "No." For the rest of us, who crave job security, I present an alternative:
- DeadlineAssistant implements algorithms produced by PERT from the US Navy to calculate more accurate completion dates, then projects a bell curve that simulates the expected time to market.
- The application was built using test-driven development, which dictates that the code be extensively unit tested for proper functioning.
- This is a practice project that I intend to tinker with to improve my own development speed and intuition

THIS PROGRAM IS *NOT*
- a paid application
- I am working on this between day jobs and family responsibilities. Expect new updates to follow the release schedule of scurrilous author/villain Patrick Rothfuss and his *Kingkiller Chronicles.*
